# Massa Demoyard

This repository contains the code for an autonomous smart contract and its associated web application. The smart contract is automatically trading tokens on the Massa blockchain. The web application is used to interact with the smart contract and display its performance.

This project has been developed during a live coding session with [BlueYard Capital](https://www.youtube.com/@blueyardcapital2782). The video of the session is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gliOv6ICWRg).
